Building a proof-of-concept platform with the idea that the big social media accounts can be cluttered & harmful. Already built:

- User signup, two-factor, email verification stuff
- Some kind of simple user profile
- Multiple projects, which would consist of:
  - What the user seeks from the project â€“ readers/feedback/an agent
  - Details depending on what the user is seeking (links for readers, type of feedback, query letters/synopses)
  - Ability to make the project public/unlisted
  - A preview so others can get a quick glimpse (like a blurb or a short sample)
  - Project meta (genres, word count, etc.)
  - Content notices

Hoping to add things along the lines of:

- Multiple projects, which would consist of:
  - Tags so others can filter by tropes/situations/types of characters in the story
- Private conversations on projects (ex: reader asks spoilery question, editor would like more info before taking on project)
- Vouching for others' projects (public reviews?)
- Linking of peers (follow system), ignoring, blocking
- A hybrid feed of some sort - not true real time, but more like a forum, but with optional notifications or something
  - General feed would have an auto-hide if a post gets flagged for review?
  - A group feature that would maybe have tabs so users could switch from "all" to specific groups of peers
  - Perhaps groups have moderators ala the forum concept?
- Direct messaging
- A pitching contest type feature similar to what the writing community on Twitter uses

This is not designed to compete with AO3/Wattpad/etc. The general idea is that this will be a platform to put the details about projects then link out to them in some way. Its main goal will be to replace the randomness and algorithm nonsense of social media, letting writers and readers (and, hopefully, agents) find what they are looking for.
